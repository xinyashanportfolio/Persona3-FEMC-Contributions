Kotone Dialogue Enhancements - Five different scenes

# ✨ Persona 3 Reload: FEMC Project – Contribution by Xinya Shan

🎮 I contributed to the **Femc Reloaded Project**, a fanmade mod that adds **Kotone (FeMC)** back into *Persona 3 Reload* for PC.

This project showcases my personal dialogue enhancements across **five unique in-game scenes**, including interactions with key characters like Koromaru and Maiko (the shrine girl).
