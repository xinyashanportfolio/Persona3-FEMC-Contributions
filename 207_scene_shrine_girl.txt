LITTLE GIRL:
"You're that girl from the dorm, right?"

KOTONE:
"That’s me. I visit the shrine when I need to feel calm. Do you come here often?"

LITTLE GIRL:
"Mmhm! I think the gods listen when you're kind like you."

KOTONE:
"Then I hope they hear you loud and clear. You’re one of the sweetest blessings here."
